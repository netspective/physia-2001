			Enhancement to Query.  You can now use the multi-criteria comparison operators like "between" and "is one of".
			All you need to do is separate multiple values with commas.  The code will now validate that you are entering
			the correct number of parameters for the operator being used and also use the type validation (i.e. dates are
			validated as dates)  For example you could enter "Date of Birth" "is between" "1/1/89, 12/31/89" and it would
			automagically convert the criteria to "01/01/1989, 12/31/1989" and perform the query correctly.
		</deliverable>
		<deliverable id="1093">
			Query conditions are now fully datatype and comparison operator sensitive.  For example if you search for a 
			date field using an operator that requires a complete value in the criteria (like "is") then it will
			validate properly and perform the query as "datefield = date('01/01/2000')".  If the operator requires a partial 
			criteria like "starts with" then it will perform the query using the datefield represented as a string of
			characters rather than the date itself. "text(datefield) LIKE '01%'"
		</deliverable>
		<deliverable id="1307">
			Fixed a problem where the session timeout was being reset before it was being checked.  Therefore sessions were
			never being timed out.
