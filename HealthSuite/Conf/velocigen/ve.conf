# The ve_env variable is used for passing information directly to
# each VET or VEP script. You can use it as you like. For example,
# you can set it to the base directory of your html files,
# the location of your tcl or perl libraries, or any other kind
# of information that your script might find useful.
# If you don't need it you can leave it commented out.
# Example: 
# ve_env:PERLLIB=/usr/local/lib/perl5:/usr/local/lib/perl5/sun-solaris/5.00401:/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl:/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/sun-solaris
# defines the environment variable 'PERLLIB' to be '/usr/lib/perl5'
# You can access this environment in your script file as you would
# normal environment variables.
